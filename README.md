# Punk identicons

Punk identicons allow you to generate punks based on a random number.

Built on Punk-blocks, this contract implements a punk-picking function.

### Address mining estimations

2^(4*N) hashes, where n is number of 0
(2^(4*14) / 350000000) seconds to years

N = number of leading zeros
350000000 = 350 Megahashes (MH)

17 = 26,722 years
16 = 1,670 years
15 = 104 years
14 = 6.5 years
13 = 0.4 years
12 = 1.3 weeks
11 = 14 hours
10 = 0.9 hours

The above is for 1 GPU. Someone with 1000 GPUs may
take significantly faster.
